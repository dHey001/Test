# Happily Aisle After Studios – Contact Card UI

A simple static HTML and CSS layout that displays a centered contact-style card on top of a full-screen background image. It is designed as a visual mockup for a photography or creative studio inquiry page.

---

## Preview

The page shows:

* A full-screen background image
* A white, rounded card in the center
* Brand header
* Service and budget display
* Submit button

This version is UI-only (no real form submission yet).

---

## Features

* Responsive layout using Flexbox
* Centered “card” design
* Background image cover effect
* Clean color theme
* Simple typography hierarchy

---

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, basic styling)

---

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html
└── img.jpg   (background image)
```

Make sure `img.jpg` is in the same folder as the HTML file.

---

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Place your background image and name it `img.jpg`.
3. Open the HTML file in any browser:

```
index.html
```

No server or setup is required.

## Notes

* The “form” fields are currently just text (`<p>` tags), not real inputs.
* The button does not submit any data.
* This is a UI mockup, not a functional form.

---

## Possible Improvements

* Replace text fields with real `<input>` and `<select>` elements
* Add a `<form>` tag and submission logic
* Add validation and error messages
* Make it mobile-optimized with media queries
